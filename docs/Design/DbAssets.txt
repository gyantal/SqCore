>1.0: In general follow IB terminology and data. We will use VBroker with them. Better to be conform. Also trading VIX futures, options.
Try to follow IB data. In VBroker I will use IB ticker "BRK B", not YfTicker "BRK-B". And try to calculate YfTicker from it. If it cannot be calculated it can be an optional given field in DB.
IB.ContractID = AssetType + AssetSubTableID (= AssetID) is also unique, but SqTicker is also unique (human readable)
IB uses ContractID, because IB talks about Contracts. However, I am doing Assets. 

>1.1 Asset.SqTicker can be made unique with rules as
    Name Intentionaly as SqTicker, and don't create a field as Ticker () because it is too general. Just "YfTicker."
    ^ as indices.
    .NAV as NAV (maybe change postfix to preFix 'N/') options for What?  Better if it is a prefix "N". Everything else is a prefix.
    CountryCode: .L would be London. So VOD and VOD.L is fine.
    VXX.SQ => SQ is SnifferQuant virtual. (that can be merged with real VXX recent prices). It is still a stock (not options), but has special Flag.
    And this would be a lastTicker. but old VOD 20 years ago is a different stock as current VOD which is alive.
    We can make SqTicker unique even historically if we attach the deathDate at the end. VOD.Date2010-03-15 (see how we do it in SQL)
    For CHAR codes, see gAssetTypeCode is AssetHelper.cs

>1.2. make MemDb and everything to be ready for multi-currency (EUR, GBX, GBP, USD) stocks, portfolios, cash. (Before expanding the universe too much). 
For that we introduce a Cash AssetType. So, there will be no single Cash in the Portfolio. It can contain many CashAssets. 
Selling GBP stock increases GBP CashAsset, selling USD stock increases USD CashAsset. 
At the end, the Portfolio can have a default Base Currency, but that is only for NAV calculation.
Beside CashAssets in currencies, there is a need for CurrencyPair (GBP/USD), for converting between them. 
A Currency pair cannot be owned (not an asset inself), but we add it into Assets, because we need daily historical AssetQuotes for them.
