Brief Conclusion:

- as a basic rule of thumb when you hesitate whether to use For/LINQ/Foreach just use For.
- as a basic rule of thumb when you hesitate about what to use with For, use the logical basic ordering. 
If the size of the set will not change, use Array. If the size of the set will change, you have to use the slower List. 
- Struct is more basic than classes. Use Struct if possible. But then it will be a value type, so it will be deep 
copied every time when it is used as a parameter (except if it is a Ref). So, sometimes, it is not advised to use it as Struct.
