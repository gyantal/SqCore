******* SVG coordinates understanding *******
SVG Path - <path>
The <path> element is used to define a path.
The following commands are available for path data:
  M = moveto
  L = lineto
  H = horizontal lineto
  V = vertical lineto
  C = curveto
  S = smooth curveto
  Q = quadratic Bézier curve
  T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
  A = elliptical Arc
  Z = closepath
Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed with lower letters. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means relatively positioned.
