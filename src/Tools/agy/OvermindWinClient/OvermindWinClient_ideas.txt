> Some part of the Overmind should live in a Server (SqCore), because it has to be running all the time. Even at night.
> Some should run on the user's Windows client.

>it basically learns from the user's daily activity, what it can do automatically. Like
	> monitoring network speed
	> monitoring whether website or Vbroker apps are online
	> reboot PC the first time when it is started today (if faulty CPU needs daily reboot)

>it should be a hiding Windows task, only available through the Windows quickbar

no idea now to implement.
